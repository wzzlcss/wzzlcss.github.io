# Optimize mini-batching

<p style="text-align:justify;">
The enhancement for SAGA performance from mini-batching depends on two things. Firstly, mini-batching is expected to benefit from the efficiency of vectorized computation, which reduces the cost of a single epoch. Secondly, while the total complexity of SAGA decreases linearly in batch size up to a certain value, emperical study also shows that the complexity explodes with values greater than an optimal mini-batch size (Gazagnadou, Gower and Salmon 2019). Therefore, we expect a batch size at the optimal point with vectorized computation to bring us the best performance enhancement.

## Optimal batch size and step size for ridge

Rather than the SAGA step $\eta = \frac{1}{3(\mu n + L_{max})}$, 

$$\begin{align}
b^*  &=  \left \lfloor 1 + \frac{\mu (n-1)}{4 (\overline{L} + \lambda)} \right \rfloor \\
\eta^* &=  \frac{1}{4} \frac{1}{max \Big \{ \mathcal{L}(b^*) + \lambda, \frac{1}{b^*} \frac{n-b^*}{n-1} L_{max} + \frac{\mu n}{4 b} \Big \}} \\
\mathcal{L}(b^*) &= \frac{n(b^* - 1)}{b^*(n-1)} L + \frac{n - b^*}{b^*(n-1)} L_{max}
\end{align}$$

where the ridge strength $\lambda$ has been added to every smoothness constant, and the mean smoothness constant $\overline{L}$ is replaced by the largest eigenvalue of $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$ if it is significantly larger than the rest. 

## Benchmark

<p style="text-align:justify;">
The benchmark [Sript] was run on [Cedar of Canada Compute](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Cedar), it is a comparison of the returned epoch loss of each run by setting ```options(sgdnet.debug = TRUE)```. These datasets is publicly accessible, they are the testing set of [YearPredictionMSD](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/regression.html#YearPredictionMSD), scaled version of [covtype.binary](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html#covtype.binary), [ijcnn1](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html#ijcnn1) from LIBSVM and unscaled version of [slice](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Relative+location+of+CT+slices+on+axial+axis) from UCI.

With optimal batch size and step size, mini-batch could converge with less epoch for most examples. Futrue work based on Eigen 3.4's functionality to get a view into submatrix by indexing with a vector of indices.
